## DESCRIPTION

Bash scripts for automated Mosaic download/compile/install on Linux boxes.

### LINUX

On Linux boxes the install process is fully automated, and right now is available for those distros:

1. Ubuntu ( tested on different ones starting from 16.04 to 20.04 )
2. Linux Mint
3. Debian ( tested from debian 9 stretch to debian 10 buster)
4. Arch Linux
5. Fedora ( starting from Fedora 29 )

Just clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/d3cod3/Mosaic-Installer
```

Then launch the install script as sudo

```bash
cd Mosaic-Installer
sudo ./mosaic_installer.sh
```

And choose your distro from the list.

Wait some...

When the script finish, you'll have Mosaic software appearing in your programs menus!

> if your distro is not on the list, and you want to contribute to this repo, you are very welcome!

### WINDOWS ( UNMAINTAINED )

Mosaic code for windows is not maintained anymore, the mosaic_windows_installer.sh script is still here just for reference, in case someone would follow the steps from there. ( In that case, good luck! )
